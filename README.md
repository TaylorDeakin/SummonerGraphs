# Summoner Graphs
The GitHub repository for Summoner Graphs, a website that compares your mastery score to your winrate.

## Setting up your own copy

If you'd like to mess around with Summoner Graphs, you'll need an API key, which you can get from [Riot Games](http://developer.riotgames.com) 

Currently, the site is set up to find an api key in a file named "private.js", which has the following format
``` javascript
module.exports = {
    apiKey: "api-key-here",
}

```

## The Idea

When Riot introduced champion masteries back in 2015, I thought it would be a cool idea to compare winrates to mastery scores, and see if a higher mastery score really resulted in a better player. A few months later, this became Summoner Graphs, a website that calcuates champion winrates, and compares them to champion mastery scores, before displaying everything on a graph.

## The Implementation

Initially Summoner Graphs was written in PHP, and was best described as a mess. It was a monster to mainain, and I wasn't really happy with how it looked either. Earlier this year I found NodeJS, and now I have rewritten the site. You can check out the source code on Github. It's not perfect, but it's much better than it was.
