The Idea
---
When Riot introduced champion masteries back in 2015, I thought it would be a cool idea to compare winrates to mastery scores, and see if a higher mastery score really resulted in a better player. A few months later, this became Summoner Graphs, a website that calcuates champion winrates, and compares them to champion mastery scores, before displaying everything on a graph.

The Implementation
---
Initially Summoner Graphs was written in PHP, and was best described as a mess. It was a monster to mainain, and I wasn't really happy with how it looked either. Earlier this year I found NodeJS, and now I have rewritten the site. You can check out the source code on Github. It's not perfect, but it's much better than it was.
